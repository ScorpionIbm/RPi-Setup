If you're trying to hide your machine's existence entirely, -j DROP is appropriate. For example, you might use this to implement a blacklist.

If you're trying to hide the fact that a port is open, you should mimic the behavior that would occur if the port was not open:

TCP: -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
UDP: -p udp -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable



If a port scanner sees that a few ports are dropping packets while most are rejecting them, it can assume the dropped packets are on ports that are open but hidden.
