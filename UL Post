[![Chart of Network Hierarchy][1]][1]

Modem/Router is connected to Internet (192.168.1.1)

No DHCP server is running on Modem/Router

Devices connect to the network through Wifi provided by Modem/Router 

Devices receive DHCP settings from RPi (DHCP and DNS server) pointing to RPi as gateway (192.168.1.5)

Using IPv4 forwarding and SNAT devices can use the RPi internet connection (SNAT 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.1.5)

**The problem**

     •	I want to control traffic to split an DOWN/UP link
        with speed 5Mbps/1Mbps and 100GB/ Month quota

     •	The idea is to not allow a single user to saturate
        the link and give priority to PCs for online games

     •	The quota is mostly used by Youtube buffering at highest quality,
        so I need to put speed limit for each user to prevent Youtube
        from automatically buffering high quality

     •	The speed limits are generally there to control the quota I have

**What I am looking for**

     •	Each user gets a certain amount of traffic 1Mbps with a ceiling of 1.5Mbps

     •	Devices of each user split the traffic between each other as follows

       o	PC gets by Max 1Mbps with higher priority

       o	Phone gets Max 1Mbps with lower priority

     •	PCs usually play online games (mostly League of Legends) 
        so I need the lowest possible latency for PCs

I made a simple script using tc and the htb qdisc but I notice lag spikes during gaming 

**The tc script is [here][2]**

Looking for better Solutions
